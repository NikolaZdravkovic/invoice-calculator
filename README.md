# Invoice-calculator

Welcome to invoice calculator! This tool calculates prices based on a percentage, allows you to input a discount amount in euros (indicating how much you want to reduce the price), and also enables you to specify the discounted price in euros.

Each input field dynamically updates the others, making the calculation process interactive and seamless.

Additionally, three fields are specifically designed for calculating discounts across all input fields.

I used for this project pure Javascript / Typescript and Css for styling in combination with Bootstrap .
